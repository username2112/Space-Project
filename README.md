# Space-Project
Space project is an AP Computer Science Special Topics semester 1 game project attempting to combine elements of both space invaders and bullet hell style of play with a player moving in all directions to avoid bullets while clearing waves of aliens in a space invaders style.

if you are trying to download from the merge-requested branch then you will need to copy all the files present in that branch to the empty src of a java project and run space invader.

if you have any asset submissions email Parker at either s-ivesp@bsd405.org or parker.school69@gmail.com
